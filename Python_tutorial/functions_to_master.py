# r stands for read
# w stands for write. Will override a file if it already exist
# a stands for append

# Instead of opening it and closing it like that, it is recommended to use the following syntax:
# Using context manager: 

with open("test.txt", "w") as file: 
    file.write("here") # Will automatically handle closing the file for us
    
with open("test.txt", "r") as file:
