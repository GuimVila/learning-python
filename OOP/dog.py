# Attributes created in .__init__() are called instance attributes. An instance attributeâ€™s value is specific to a particular instance of the class. All Dog objects have a name and an age, but the values for the name and age attributes will vary depending on the Dog instance.
# On the other hand, class attributes are attributes that have the same value for all class instances. You can define a class attribute by assigning a value to a variable name outside of .__init__().

# Creating a new object from a class is called instantiating a class.

print(nala.name)
print(nala.species)

# Although the attributes are guaranteed to exist, their values can change dynamically:

nala.species = "Felis silvestris"
